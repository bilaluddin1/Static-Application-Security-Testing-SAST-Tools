# üõ°Ô∏è Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools

This repository is dedicated to hosting and exploring Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. SAST tools analyze your source code, bytecode, or binaries to detect security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle ‚Äî before the code is compiled or deployed.

üîç What is SAST?
Static Application Security Testing is a white-box testing method that examines application code for coding flaws, insecure patterns, and vulnerabilities such as:

SQL injection (SQLi)

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Hardcoded secrets

Insecure cryptographic practices

SAST tools help developers and security teams identify and remediate issues at the code level, often integrating directly into IDEs or CI/CD pipelines for continuous feedback.

üöÄ What to Expect in this Repository

Open-source and commercial SAST tools

Sample configuration files and usage examples

Comparisons of different tools (e.g., Semgrep, SonarQube, CodeQL, Bandit, etc.)

Guides for integrating SAST into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)

Best practices for secure code analysis and rule customization
